# nodejs-template

This is a totally stripped down template for a node.js webapp. It's designed to be forked and built on

There is no database in this version. This is a point-and-clicker

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

## Running Locally

```sh
git clone git@github.com:hamishdickson/nodejs-template.git # or clone your own fork
cd nodejs-template/app
npm install
node server.js
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

The port can be changed in app/server.js
